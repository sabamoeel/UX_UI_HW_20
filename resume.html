                I am a Jill-Of-All-Trades interaction designer and illustrator with a BFA in fashion
                design from Parsons. I have over 20 years of professional design and visual
                merchandising experience, with proven sales metrics and quantifiable social
                engagement. My strongest skill is being able to understand how people think and what
                they want, whether that is merchandise, content, or navigation through a store or mobile
                experience. I have a deep and unusual understanding of people’s behavior and desires. I
                have built and managed teams and partnerships for over 10 years.<br><br>
